## Learning log assignments

Favorite aspects: R markdown looks great 

Superfluous aspects: none

Eureka effect: version control systems (although only SPSS-syntax before, they've been messed up always after a longer project)

Links to what I've learned so far: hard to say in first session

```{r}
##Assign the value of 2 to a variable called a and the value of 5 to a variable called b
a<-2
b<-5
##Compute the sum, difference, product, ratio of a and b
r1<-a+b
r2<-a-b
r3<-a*b
r4<-a/b
##Create a vector v1 with variables from step 2
v1<-(c(r1,r2,r3,r4))
##Add a fifth entry to vector v1 
r5<-a**b
v1[5]<-r5
#or
v1<-(c(r1,r2,r3,r4))
v1[5]<-a**b
#or
v1<-(c(r1,r2,r3,r4))
v1<-append(v1, r5,5)
##Create a second vector v2 with information on operation type
v2<-c("sum","difference", "product", "ratio", "power")
##Show the content of vector v2 
print(v2)
##combine the two vectors v1 and v2 into a data frame and Name the columns
df<-data.frame(Results=v1, Operation=v2)
##show entire content
df
##show content of 3 row and 1 column
df[3,1]

```
